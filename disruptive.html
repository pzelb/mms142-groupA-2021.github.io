				<h1 id="difference">DIFFERENCE OF EDGE COMPUTING AND CLOUD COMPUTING</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="vsright">
				<h1>CLOUD COMPUTING</h1>
				<p>Cloud computing in the most simplest form is any computing processes that are done via the internet. All the data are accessed, stored, and processed through the web which are all located in a massive storage system of data called data centers.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="vsleft">
				<h1>EDGE COMPUTING</h1>
				<p>Edge computing on the other hand, can be seen as sort of the "middleman" that places all the computing resources closer to the user instead of having to travel from the main server and back which can cause latency issues.
					It is like storing it in a cache memory for later use. Edge computing is a game-breaking concept that when it is implemented alongside what we have now which is cloud computing, can solve a lot of security risks, delays, and better user experience.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="center">
				<h1 style="color:#35605A;text-align:center;"><em>Edge is more of an extension to cloud rather than a competition<em></h3>
				<p style="font-weight:700;">“By processing incoming data at the edge, less information needs to be sent to the cloud and back. This also significantly reduces processing latency. A good analogy would be a popular pizza restaurant that opens smaller branches in more neighborhoods, since a pie baked at the main location would get cold on its way to a distant customer.” - Michael Clegg</p>
				<h1 id="industry"> HOW EDGE COMPUTING ENABLES INDUSTRY 4.0</h1>
				<p>Industry 4.0 (The Fourth Industrial Evolution)(4IR) is a breakthrough for technology as it is comprised of inventions that push the limits of the 3d world and the digital world. It is where technology makes use of data and smart machinery to
					improve and alter the human experience and livelihood. However, there are certain limitations that Industry 4.0 faces. Mainly it involves speed, versatility, and tech resources. This is where Edge Computing initiates the proper transition to the 4IR.</p>
					<p>With its following aspects:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Interoperability - the capability to work with other systems now and in the future, future-proofed.</li>
					<li>Granularity - The more granular the data, the more detailed it is and the more precise analysis can be.</li>
					<li>Inclusive - equipped with both physical and informational identities.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Edge computing is an essential form of computer processing that can push us through the 4th Industrial Evolution.</p>

				<h1 id="status" style="text-align:center;">CURRENT STATUS OF CLOUD SERVERS AND EDGE COMPUTING</h1>
				<p>Cloud adoption grew significantly in 2020 because of COVID-19. Plenty of the enterprises surveyed by Flexera (2021) have been adopting the multi-cloud approach as their dominant strategy to
					maximize the use of both multiple public and multiple private clouds. Despite the complexity and dynamic nature of the multi-cloud environment, public cloud spend has been increasing because of the demand of organizations.
					This may be attributed to the cloud's scalability, economy and reach.</p>
					
				<p>Since edge computing is IoT-oriented, developers have been looking for sustainable ways of coping with the predicted volume of data IoT devices will be producing in the near future (Atos, 2021). The prevailing architecture of IoT is still centralized, so furthering the improvement of connectivity and response times through better edge data handling and security, edge software frameworks, function control and standardization are currently in the works.</p>	
				<p>Incorporating intelligence to edge is believed to heighten the security of edge devices and applications because its control can be multi-layered. It can cater to physical or perimeter security, firmware and operating systems, edge applications and edge networks. *Edge software frameworks are meant to optimize the heterogeneity of edge computing, the feature that allows edge devices to be hard-wired or battery-powered. The emphasis of the developments are on lifecycle management and real-time control functions. Developers are making the most out of the open source initiatives EdgeX Foundry, Eclipse Kura, KubeEdge and Open Stack Starlingx. *Ensuring the operational nature of edge environments maintains its value in the service sector and data quality. But since there are various challenges under service management, "multiple software solutions are often required to address each function and problem" (Atos, 2021). Thus, the need for a complete service ecosystem for edge management, namely: device managers, zero-touch provisioning, connectivity management platforms, and monitoring tools. </p>

				<h1 id="whathow" style="text-align:left;">WHAT MAKES AN INNOVATION DISRUPTIVE</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>takes time (to become mainstream)</li>
					<li>offers something unique</li>
					<li>when entrepreneurs offer a service that more or less is similar to existing services except, with additional features</li>
				</ul>
				<br><br>
				<h1>How is Edge Computing considered disruptive?</h1>
				<p>it is currently under research and many beta testing. That said, it'll take time for it to be set for public use.</p>
